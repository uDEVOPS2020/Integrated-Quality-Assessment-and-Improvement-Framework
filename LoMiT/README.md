This repo contains the scripts used for the log-driven test generation.
It is caharacterized by two folders:

+ `LLM_fine-tuning_inference`: containing the scripts to perform both the fine-tuning of the transformer and the inference.
+  `Tests_generation_analysis`: containing the scripts to generate the tests using the `uTest` tool, starting from the output provided by the transformer.
