   - Output:

     - Folder containing all the files needed by `uTest` to perform the different test generation

+ `generate_and_run_tests.sh`: uses the folder generated by the previous script to generate and run the tests using `uTest`. Please note that both `uTest` and the target system should be running

  - Input: 

    - Folder containing all the files needed by `uTest` to perform the different test generation (generated by the preiovus script)
    - Path to folder where `uTest` expect the files for test generation

  - Output:
