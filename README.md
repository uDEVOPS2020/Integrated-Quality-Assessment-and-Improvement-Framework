# Integrated Quality Assessment and Improvement Framework

## Overview

This repository serves as a proof of concept for the project, whos aim was to share and enhance knowledge about software quality in microservice systems through a unified view. 
The PoC integrates diverse testing techniques, facilitating both quality assessment and improvement. It leverages data from code repositories, system logs, and runtime performance metrics to support Fault Avoidance, Fault Prediction, Fault Removal, Fault Tolerance
Targeted quality attributes include Reliability, Robustness, Performance, Energy Consumption.

All developed artifacts, including code and documentation, are housed within this repository and its sub-repositories.

## Repository Structure

This repository aggregates multiple sub-repositories, each dedicated to a specific testing technique. Each sub-repository contains its own `README.md` file detailing functionality, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.

## Categories

The services are categorized based on:

1. **Stage**: Dev or Ops  
2. **Goal**: Improvement or Assessment  
3. **Scope**: Fault Avoidance, Prediction, Removal, or Tolerance  
4. **Quality Attribute**: Various quality attributes are assessed or improved
