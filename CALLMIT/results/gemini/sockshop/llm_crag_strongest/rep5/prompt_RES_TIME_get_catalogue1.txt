==========System Prompt==========

<|system|>
Use the following constraints:
- NUSER has to be less than 51
- NUSER has to be greater than 4
- LOAD has to be 'stress_shop' or 'stress_cart' or 'normal'
- SR has to be '1' or 10 or 5
Use the following causal paths:
NUSER -> RES_TIME_login -> RES_TIME_get_catalogue1
LOAD -> RES_TIME_login -> RES_TIME_get_catalogue1
SR -> CPU_login -> REQ/s_get_catalogue1 -> RES_TIME_get_catalogue1

Use the following context to help:
{context}<|end|>
<|user|>
{question}
<|assistant|>


==========Human==========

Generate one JSON structure (NUSER, LOAD, SR) which leads RES_TIME_get_catalogue1 to exceed 5.896222892326504<|end|>

Provide the results in JSON format, matching the structure of the triple:
- NUSER: the user size
- LOAD: the operational profile
- SR: the spawn rate
