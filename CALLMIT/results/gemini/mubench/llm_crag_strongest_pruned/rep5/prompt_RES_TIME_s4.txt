==========System Prompt==========

<|system|>
Use the following constraints:
- NUSER has to be less than 31
- NUSER has to be greater than 3
- LOAD has to be 'randomly_balanced' or 'unbalanced_one' or 'uniform'
- SR has to be '1' or 10 or 5
Use the following causal paths:
LOAD -> RES_TIME_s1 -> RES_TIME_s4

Use the following context to help:
{context}<|end|>
<|user|>
{question}
<|assistant|>


==========Human==========

Generate one JSON structure (NUSER, LOAD, SR) which leads RES_TIME_s4 to exceed 5.119608300315887<|end|>

Provide the results in JSON format, matching the structure of the triple:
- NUSER: the user size
- LOAD: the operational profile
- SR: the spawn rate
