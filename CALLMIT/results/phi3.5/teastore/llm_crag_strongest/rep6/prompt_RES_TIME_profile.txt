==========Prompt==========

<|system|>
Use the following constraints:
- NUSER has to be less than 31
- NUSER has to be greater than 3
- LOAD has to be 'stress_shop' or 'normal' or 'stress_cart'
- SR has to be '1' or 10 or 5
Use the following causal paths:
NUSER -> CPU_addToCart -> CPU_view_product -> REQ/s_category -> REQ/s_buy -> REQ/s_logout -> MEM_teastore-db -> REQ/s_login -> CPU_teastore-persistence -> REQ/s_home -> CPU_teastore-image -> RES_TIME_profile
LOAD -> REQ/s_buy -> REQ/s_logout -> MEM_teastore-db -> REQ/s_login -> CPU_teastore-persistence -> REQ/s_home -> CPU_teastore-image -> RES_TIME_profile
SR -> MEM_addToCart -> MEM_home -> MEM_teastore-db -> REQ/s_login -> CPU_teastore-persistence -> REQ/s_home -> CPU_teastore-image -> RES_TIME_profile

Use the following context to help:
{context}<|end|>
<|user|>
{question}
<|assistant|>


==========Question==========

Generate one JSON structure (NUSER, LOAD, SR) which leads RES_TIME_profile to exceed 7.7794069784134265<|end|>

Provide the results in JSON format, matching the structure of the triple:
- NUSER: the user size
- LOAD: the operational profile
- SR: the spawn rate
