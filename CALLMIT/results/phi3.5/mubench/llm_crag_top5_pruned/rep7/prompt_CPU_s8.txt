Use the following constraints:
- NUSER has to be less than 31
- NUSER has to be greater than 3
- LOAD has to be 'randomly_balanced' or 'unbalanced_one' or 'uniform'
- SR has to be '1' or 10 or 5
Use the following causal paths:
NUSER -> CPU_s3 -> REQ/s_s5 -> REQ/s_s2 -> REQ/s_s4 -> REQ/s_s3 -> REQ/s_s7 -> REQ/s_s8 -> CPU_s8
NUSER -> CPU_s3 -> REQ/s_s5 -> REQ/s_s2 -> REQ/s_s4 -> REQ/s_s3 -> REQ/s_s9 -> REQ/s_s8 -> CPU_s8
NUSER -> CPU_s3 -> REQ/s_s5 -> REQ/s_s2 -> REQ/s_s4 -> REQ/s_s3 -> REQ/s_s8 -> CPU_s8
NUSER -> CPU_s3 -> REQ/s_s5 -> REQ/s_s2 -> REQ/s_s4 -> REQ/s_s9 -> REQ/s_s8 -> CPU_s8
NUSER -> REQ/s_s5 -> REQ/s_s2 -> REQ/s_s4 -> REQ/s_s3 -> REQ/s_s7 -> REQ/s_s8 -> CPU_s8
LOAD -> RES_TIME_s1 -> REQ/s_s5 -> REQ/s_s2 -> REQ/s_s4 -> REQ/s_s3 -> REQ/s_s7 -> REQ/s_s8 -> CPU_s8
LOAD -> RES_TIME_s1 -> REQ/s_s5 -> REQ/s_s2 -> REQ/s_s4 -> REQ/s_s3 -> REQ/s_s9 -> REQ/s_s8 -> CPU_s8
LOAD -> RES_TIME_s1 -> REQ/s_s5 -> REQ/s_s2 -> REQ/s_s4 -> REQ/s_s3 -> REQ/s_s8 -> CPU_s8
LOAD -> RES_TIME_s1 -> REQ/s_s5 -> REQ/s_s2 -> REQ/s_s4 -> REQ/s_s9 -> REQ/s_s8 -> CPU_s8
LOAD -> REQ/s_s3 -> REQ/s_s7 -> REQ/s_s8 -> CPU_s8
SR -> CPU_s3 -> REQ/s_s5 -> REQ/s_s2 -> REQ/s_s4 -> REQ/s_s3 -> REQ/s_s7 -> REQ/s_s8 -> CPU_s8
SR -> CPU_s3 -> REQ/s_s5 -> REQ/s_s2 -> REQ/s_s4 -> REQ/s_s3 -> REQ/s_s9 -> REQ/s_s8 -> CPU_s8
SR -> CPU_s3 -> REQ/s_s5 -> REQ/s_s2 -> REQ/s_s4 -> REQ/s_s3 -> REQ/s_s8 -> CPU_s8
SR -> CPU_s3 -> REQ/s_s5 -> REQ/s_s2 -> REQ/s_s4 -> REQ/s_s9 -> REQ/s_s8 -> CPU_s8

==========Question==========

Generate one JSON structure (NUSER, LOAD, SR) which leads CPU_s8 to exceed 4.432075799870776<|end|>

Provide the results in JSON format, matching the structure of the triple:
- NUSER: the user size
- LOAD: the operational profile
- SR: the spawn rate
