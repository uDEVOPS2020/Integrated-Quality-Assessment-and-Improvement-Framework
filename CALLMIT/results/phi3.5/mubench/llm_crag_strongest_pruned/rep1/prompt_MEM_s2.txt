==========Prompt==========

<|system|>
Use the following constraints:
- NUSER has to be less than 31
- NUSER has to be greater than 3
- LOAD has to be 'uniform' or 'randomly_balanced' or 'unbalanced_one'
- SR has to be '1' or 10 or 5
Use the following causal paths:
NUSER->CPU_s3->MEM_s0->MEM_s2
LOAD->RES_TIME_s1->MEM_s1->MEM_s0->MEM_s2
SR->MEM_s7->MEM_s1->MEM_s0->MEM_s2

Use the following context to help:

==========Question==========

Generate one JSON structure (NUSER, LOAD, SR) which leads MEM_s2 to exceed 198.4978447619339<|end|>

Provide the results in JSON format, matching the structure of the triple:
- NUSER: the user size
- LOAD: the operational profile
- SR: the spawn rate
