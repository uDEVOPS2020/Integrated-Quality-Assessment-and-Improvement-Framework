Use the following constraints:
- NUSER has to be less than 51
- NUSER has to be greater than 4
- LOAD has to be 'stress_cart' or 'normal' or 'stress_shop'
- SR has to be '1' or 10 or 5
Use the following causal paths:
NUSER -> CPU_login -> CPU_get_catalogue1 -> CPU_get_catalogue2 -> CPU_get_tags
LOAD -> CPU_login -> CPU_get_catalogue1 -> CPU_get_catalogue2 -> CPU_get_tags

Use the following context to help:

==========Question==========

Generate one JSON structure (NUSER, LOAD, SR) which leads CPU_get_tags to exceed 4.325202281819119<|end|>

Provide the results in JSON format, matching the structure of the triple:
- NUSER: the user size
- LOAD: the operational profile
- SR: the spawn rate
