==========Prompt==========

<|system|>
Use the following constraints:
- NUSER has to be less than 51
- NUSER has to be greater than 4
- LOAD has to be 'stress_cart' or 'normal' or 'stress_shop'
- SR has to be '1' or 10 or 5
Use the following causal paths:
NUSER -> CPU_login -> REQ/s_get_catalogue1 -> REQ/s_get_catalogue2 -> RES_TIME_get_catalogue3 -> REQ/s_get_item -> REQ/s_get_related -> REQ/s_get_cart -> CPU_get_cart
LOAD -> RES_TIME_login -> REQ/s_get_catalogue1 -> REQ/s_get_catalogue2 -> RES_TIME_get_catalogue3 -> REQ/s_get_item -> REQ/s_get_related -> REQ/s_get_cart -> CPU_get_cart
SR -> CPU_login -> REQ/s_get_catalogue1 -> REQ/s_get_catalogue2 -> RES_TIME_get_catalogue3 -> REQ/s_get_item -> REQ/s_get_related -> REQ/s_get_cart -> CPU_get_cart

Use the following context to help:

{question}

==========Question==========

Generate one JSON structure (NUSER, LOAD, SR) which leads CPU_get_cart to exceed 70.00301586723278<|end|>

Provide the results in JSON format, matching the structure of the triple:
- NUSER: the user size
- LOAD: the operational profile
- SR: the spawn rate
